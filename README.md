## Mima Assembler Syntax

##### Mnemoic + Value/Address

- always use mnemonics, op codes are not supported (yet)
- values can be written hex (e.g. 0x1A4) or decimal

```
LDC   41
ADD   0xFF1
STV   0xFF1
0xFF1 0x1
```

##### Labels + Jumps

- labels are case sensitive
- it's not a good idea to jump to a self defined address, unless you know what you are doing
- for now, labels MUST be declared before a jump

```
:Loop         // this is a label/jump target
LDV   0xAFFE  // some fancy calculation
NOT
STV   0xAFFE
JMP Loop      // will jump to label :Loop
```

##### Define storage

- you can define the value at a specific memory address
- the value can be a variable or an instruction

```
LDV   0xFF1
...   
0xFF1 0x1   //puts a one at 0xFF1
```

##### Memory Mapped I/O

The mimas "general purpose" memory is defined from **0x0000 0000 - 0x0C00 0000**.
Addresses above **0x0C00 0000** are used for memory mapped I/O.

There are some defined addresses you can use to output information to the terminal:

- **0x0c000001** single char input
- **0x0c000002** integer input
- **0x0c000003** single char output
- **0x0c000004** integer output

e.g.

```
LDV 0xC000001   // will ask for single char
LDV 0xC000002   // will ask for integer
LDC 42
STV 0xC000003   // will print a '*' to the terminal
LDC 0x40
STV 0xC000004   // will print a 64 to the terminal

```
##### Comments

Every lines first "word" that could not be identified as mnemonic, address, nor label, will be ignored.
Therefore you can use something like "//" or "#" for comments in separate lines (or even after valid commands).

e.g.
```
// this will be ignored
ADD 0x01 #you can also do that
STV 0x00 // and this
```
